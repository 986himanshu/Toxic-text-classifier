# Notes on the Classification Task for Toxic Text Detection
## Purpose
This proof of concept (PoC) notebook implements a classification task aimed at detecting whether given text data is toxic or non-toxic. The model can be extended for integration into web applications or real-time pipelines, enabling use cases such as moderating user-generated content on websites or apps by flagging toxic content.

## Modularization Opportunities
The following components can be modularized for integration into a web application or API backend:

### Data Ingestion:

A module to accept upstream data from a website or app in formats like JSON, CSV, or direct API calls.
Preprocessing Pipeline:

Encapsulate text preprocessing steps into reusable functions or classes.
### Model Serving:

### Export the trained model (e.g., via joblib or pickle) for deployment.
Create a prediction endpoint to handle incoming text data and return toxicity labels.
### Evaluation Dashboard:

Add monitoring and logging modules to track model performance in production.
### Error Handling:

Implement safeguards for missing data, inappropriate inputs, and upstream issues.

## Potential Use Cases
### Content Moderation:

Automatically detect and flag toxic comments or messages on forums, social media, or chat applications.
### Feedback Filtering:

Identify harmful or inappropriate feedback in customer support systems.
### Compliance Monitoring:

Ensure text-based compliance with community standards or legal regulations.
### Educational Applications:

Analyze toxic language in classrooms or digital education platforms to promote healthy communication.
